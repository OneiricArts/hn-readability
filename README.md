This is a client for the popular tech-focused [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) forum, created with a focus on UX.

Some highlights:

- Designed for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Light/Dark mode depending on device settings
- UI focuses on content, not on chrome
- A few restrained animations
- Each item has an easy link back to the original Hacker News url
- Front page:
  - floating button to hide read stories (stored locally, does not sync)
  - comment page easily accessibly by clicking chat icon on right
- Comment page:
  - click to collapse comment and that comment's children
  - floating button to navigate to next top-level commment

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
